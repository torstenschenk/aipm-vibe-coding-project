# Group Vibe-Coding Project Brief

Build and present a small, end-to-end application in groups of 2–3 using the [vibe-coding tools](#popular-vibe-coding-tools). The goal is rapid, AI-assisted delivery with clear prompts, minimal hand-coding, and a tight presentation.

### What to build
- Pick a simple but end-to-end app (e.g., habit tracker, mini ticket board, event RSVP, micro SaaS landing with signup). This can be a chance to prototype your capstone idea—don’t over-hunt for data. 
- Scope for 1–2 core user journeys; keep the rest as stretch goals.
- Favor AI IDE/CLI agents for glue code (VSCode Copilot, Cursor, OpenAI Codex CLI, Antigravity, Windsurf, Claude Code, Cline, OpenCode) and hosted AI builders for UI (v0, Lovable, Bolt.new, Emergent).
- Most tools have free tiers; you can try multiple without paying.

### Process
1) Formation & setup: Create a repo, assign roles (Driver, Prompt Engineer, QA/Tester, Presenter). Rotate Driver/Prompt Engineer mid-way.  
2) Tooling: Choose at least two tools from the table. Note why you picked them.
3) Prompting: Ask chatbots to draft strong prompts for what you want to do. Use [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) to store and update project instructions (see https://agents.md).
4) Build loops: Ship in short cycles (plan → prompt → review → adjust). Keep manual edits minimal; prefer refining prompts.  
5) Testing: Add quick checks (e.g., smoke test script, manual checklist).  
6) Polish: Add basic styling or data fixtures so the demo feels real.  
7) Presentation prep: Dry-run the demo; ensure repo instructions work on a clean machine.

### Deliverables (due at presentation)
- Running app with clear start instructions in `README.md` (or link to hosted preview).  
- `AGENTS.md` with instructions for the AI tools.
- A 5-minute live demo covering: problem, user journey, tool choice, key prompts, what worked/failed, and what you’d do next.

### Evaluation (keep it lightweight)
- Outcome: Does the core user journey work end-to-end?  
- Prompt craft: Did you steer the tools effectively (specific, iterative prompts)?  
- Tool fit: Were tool choices justified and used, not just listed?  
- Collaboration: Clear roles, handoffs, and shared ownership.  
- Presentation: Focus on your experience with the tools—what worked, what didn’t, and what you’d try next time.

### Popular Vibe Coding Tools

Vibe coding refers to an intuitive, AI-assisted approach to software development where natural language prompts guide the creation of code, apps, or prototypes, often emphasizing flow, creativity, and minimal manual coding.
